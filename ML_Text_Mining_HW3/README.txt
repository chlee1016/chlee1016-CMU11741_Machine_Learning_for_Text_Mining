The source code files are composed of LSTM.py, CNN.py.
Each of python files implement data loading, preprocessing, modeling, evaluating, visualizing, etc.
Both of the code files are similar but different in modeling part.
LSTM.py : Text classification by using LSTM model, with utilizing keras.layers.LSTM library.
CNN.py : Text classification by using CNN model, with utilizing keras.layers.Conv1D library.
All you have to do is just running each python files, then you can check the processes in the output console.
